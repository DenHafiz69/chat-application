# Chat Application Demo

## How To Run:



## Roadmap:

1. Direct messaging: Two users can chat with each other
2. Typing indicator: When typing, the recipient gets notified
3. User status: Whether you are online or offline

## Things To Consider

1. Type of messages: Text only? Probably some images too in the future
2. Limits: Size of a single message
3. Security: What type of encryption to use
